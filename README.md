Hi everyone ! ðŸ™Œ

Welcome to my GitHub. 

My name is AndrÃ© and I introduce you "Simulating_our_future", 
a project that is willing to explain climate change and our impact on Earth through easy data comprehension and concise educative videos.

I'll be posting some repositories and explanations on metholodogies used for these projects.

The projects are available on Simulating_our_future's social media so it can reach a maximum of non-aware people.

They last approximately 30 seconds and are displayed on these platforms :

- TikTok (https://www.tiktok.com/@simulating_our_future)
- Instagram Reels (https://www.instagram.com/simulating_our_future)
- Facebook Reels (https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100087377094241)
